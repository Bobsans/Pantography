# Pantography
Minecraft plugin: Copy Map item data to other Maps including different scale Maps.

A pantograph is "is a mechanical linkage connected in a manner based on parallelograms so that the movement of one pen, in tracing an image, produces identical movements in a second pen. If a line drawing is traced by the first point, an identical, enlarged, or miniaturized copy will be drawn by a pen fixed to the other" \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph)\].

Place two Filled Maps into a crafting grid - the first will be the destination Map, and the second the source Map.  The maps can be different scales and different areas.  

The resulting Filled Map will be the destination Map with any data that fits into its area from the source Map copied into any blank pixels of the destination Map - and the source Map will be left in the crafting grid unchanged.
